# About this Research

This research has as an objective gain an initial understanding of the dimension Group Movement in Videogames has. The focus is on simplicity and to serve as an introduction to the matter. It covers the creation and management of Groups in a simple way, but does not go deeply into Steering behaviours, Local collision avoidance or Pathfinding. The goal is moving units from A to B while letting them overlap, but keeping them apart in the end, in a simple formation.
